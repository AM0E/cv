          <h3>Watching Friends Series</h3>
          <p>I remembered that day I was bored and got nothing to do so I watched the first episode and I liked it very much. Moreover, it does effect my English listening and speaking skills which are necessay in these days. I have watched this series for 5 times and will keep watching whenever I am bored. For those who don't like Friends, please try to find the answer from Rachel.</p>
